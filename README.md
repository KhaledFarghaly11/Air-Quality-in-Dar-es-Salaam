# Air-Quality-in-Dar-es-Salaam 

## Dataset Description:

Data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica (https://africaopendata.org/).

## Objectives:

- I looked at air quality data from Dar es Salaam, and built a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.
- I got data by querying a MongoDB database.
- I prepared time series data for analysis.
- I built an autoregression model.
- I improved a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
